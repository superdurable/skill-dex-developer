# Observability for Python applications

Log Flow/run IDs, Step type/execution ID, attempt, and operation as structured fields. Keep IDs out of metric labels. Persist external request IDs if retries need them.

Heartbeat is liveness/checkpoint data for one Execute attempt. It is not business state. Async handlers await heartbeat; synchronous generator handlers yield the heartbeat output. Resume only from a present, correctly typed prior value.

```python
        completed_batches = context.get_last_heartbeat_value(int) or 0
        for batch in range(completed_batches, batches):
            if context.is_cancellation_requested():
                return dead_end()
            await asyncio.sleep(2)
            await context.heartbeat(batch + 1)
        return graceful_complete("processed")
```

Use summary/status for execution state, history for causality, a typed snapshot RPC for business state, Streams for progress, and metrics for rates/saturation. Track attempt duration/count, exhaustion, timeout handlers, RPC conflicts, Channel backlog, Stream lag, Worker reachability, and BlobCache errors.

For a stall: identify Flow/run; inspect latest history and active attempt; verify registered types; verify Dex reaches advertised Worker target; inspect exception chain.
