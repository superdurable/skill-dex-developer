# Observability for Go applications

## Correlation and signals

Log Flow ID, run ID, Step type/execution ID, attempt, and operation. Keep high-cardinality IDs out of metric labels. Persist external request IDs when needed across retries.

Heartbeat is liveness/checkpoint data for one long attempt, not business state. Resume only when a previous value exists, and return heartbeat errors.

```go
	for batch := completedBatches; batch < batches; batch++ {
		select {
		case <-ctx.Done():
			return dex.DeadEnd(), nil
		default:
		}
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		if err := ctx.RecordHeartbeat(batch + 1); err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
	}
	return dex.GracefulComplete("processed"), nil
```

Use summary/status for execution state, history for causality, a typed snapshot RPC for business state, Streams for progress, and metrics for saturation/failure rates. Track attempts, exhaustion, timeout handlers, RPC latency/conflicts, Channel backlog, Stream lag, Worker connectivity, and BlobCache errors.

For a stall: confirm IDs/status; inspect latest history and active attempt; verify registered types; verify Dex can reach the advertised Worker target; then inspect the application error chain. Supported read surfaces appear in the pinned [client controller](https://github.com/superdurable/dex/blob/4c18c7d04135053c6a3f387a8f411c918f7ba803/examples/go/primitives/client-apis/controller.go).
