# Rust data handling

Dex values cross process boundaries. Model them as owned, serde-compatible types with stable field meaning. Keep ephemeral handles, clients, sockets, and service objects out of Flow inputs, Attribute values, Channel messages, RPC payloads, and Step movements.

## Types and ownership

Use `#[derive(Clone, Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]` for application payloads that traverse Dex. Prefer owned `String`, `Vec<T>`, and owned nested structs at durable boundaries. Borrow within one handler where useful, but return owned values in decisions and RPC results. Treat schema names and serialized fields as compatibility contracts for open Flows.

Use module-level `static LazyLock<T>` for `Attribute`, `Channel`, and `Stream` definitions. An `AttributeMap` or `ChannelMap` may be an owned Flow field when the Flow must clone it into multiple Step values; clone the schema object, not live durable data.

## Persistence schema

Register every definition used by a Flow. Registration catches a load for an undeclared definition. Keep logical names stable and unique within the Flow. Use maps when the set of keys grows dynamically; do not create dynamic logical definition names.

            .attribute(&EMAIL)
            .attribute_map(&self.progress)
    }
```

## Selective loading

Map and Channel state is not implicitly hydrated for every invocation. Declare phase-specific loads on `StepOptions`, or attach loads to an RPC definition. Load a full map only when the algorithm truly needs all instances; prefer `attribute_map.load(instance)` or `channel_map.load_messages(instance)` for one partition.

<!-- dex-source: examples/rust/src/primitives/channel/flow.rs -->
```rust
    fn options(&self) -> StepOptions<Self::Input> {
        StepOptions::new().execute_load_channel(&QUEUED_MESSAGES)
    }
```

Loading controls availability in Worker Context; it does not request serialization between competing writers.

## Locks and transactions

Use `Attribute::lock()` or `AttributeMap::lock(instance)` for a read-modify-write invariant. Locks select transactional RPC execution. If an RPC deletes and republishes Channel messages without an Attribute lock, request `Rpc::is_transactional()` explicitly. Attach every state load the transaction reads.

Do not hold application-process mutexes as a substitute. A Worker can be replaced, and multiple Workers can execute the same Flow type.

## Commit boundaries

WaitFor and Execute are separate retryable method executions. Durable writes made in one phase are committed according to that phase's result; do not rely on Rust stack state crossing the boundary. RPC handlers have their own atomicity rules. Model checkpoints in Attributes or Channels before external side effects when recovery needs to distinguish “not attempted” from “possibly accepted.”

## Large values and BlobCache

Client and Worker share an `Arc<BlobCache>` so payload hydration and upload can use local content-addressed storage. Choose a process-local directory, byte capacity, and entry capacity; close the cache during shutdown. The example bootstrap is the source of truth for constructor shape.

[Runnable source](https://github.com/superdurable/dex/blob/4c18c7d04135053c6a3f387a8f411c918f7ba803/examples/rust/src/main.rs)
<!-- dex-source: examples/rust/src/main.rs -->
```rust
    let cache = Arc::new(BlobCache::open(BlobCacheConfig::new(
        cache_directory,
        64 * 1024 * 1024,
        10_000,
    )?)?);
```

Do not use BlobCache as business persistence. Durable references remain owned by Dex; local cache entries are replaceable acceleration.

The Server keeps payloads through 100 bytes inline by default. Treat internal blob references as opaque: hydration and cache lookup use the owning Flow ID with the reference, and Dex rewrites blob-backed values that cross into another Flow. String and Object references share a compact six-digit-date shape; their Value arms distinguish them. Object Blobs store the complete EncodedObject with `json`, `raw`, or a custom encoding, so references have no encoding suffix. The Server's `objectIdLength` defaults to 10, accepts any positive length, and treats zero as the default; readers accept any nonempty lowercase Base36 object ID.

ASYNC local Step input snapshots are disabled by default. Enable the Server's `blobStore.asyncStepInputSnapshotsEnabled` only when semantic history needs exact method inputs; it does not affect execution, retry, or recovery.

Rust JSON null uses the Value null arm and decodes as `serde_json::Value::Null`. In an Attribute write null deletes the Attribute, and as a Flow completion output it is discarded. Return an explicit result type when terminal null and no output must differ.

## Attribute Store and search

Mark selected Attributes with `sync_to_attribute_store` only when an external projection needs them. Configure store names in `FlowConfig`. Index only fields needed for search, and keep index keys stable. Search is for discovery; an RPC or Attribute read should confirm current authoritative Flow state before mutation.
